"""``plugin`` — the agent's own entry into the plugin market.

Before this tool the agent had no way to reach PlugHub at all: asked to connect
an integration it could only send the user to the plugin panel, or hand-roll an
OAuth flow with ``exec`` -- which produces a token in a temp directory and a
server that was never configured. The engine was already there and already
good; it was only reachable from the RPC surface the panel talks to.

So this is deliberately a thin, honest shell over
:mod:`raven.market.connect`: the same install transaction, the same rollback
rule, the same bounded connect kick the panel runs. What it adds is the
conversation's half of the job -- fuzzy lookup, prose the model can act on, and
the authorization link, because a turn cannot wait for a person to click.

Three boundaries this tool does not cross:

* it installs only from the trusted catalog, never from a URL or command line
  the model composed -- entry ids in, nothing else;
* it accepts no credentials. A plugin whose install needs an API key is
  reported with the field's name so the user can enter it where secrets belong,
  rather than pasted through a tool call and into the transcript;
* it opens no browser. A turn answers with the authorization link and lets the
  surface the user is actually looking at offer it -- see
  :class:`raven.mcp.oauth._Flow` for why the host running a turn is
  not necessarily the machine the person who asked is sitting at.
