"""Reusable RPC stack assembly for headless transports (`raven serve`).

Extracted shape of the wiring in ``tui_commands._run_rpc_server_until_done``:
AgentLoop + brokers + SubscriptionEmitter + spine scheduler + method
registration, minus any transport. The caller supplies a ``send_frame``
sink (the TUI hands it a single socket writer; ``raven serve`` hands it a
WebSocket broadcast), so the same engine assembly serves both transports.

    Must run inside the event loop that will serve requests (cron start and
    the spine scheduler bind to the running loop).

    ``agent_loop`` mounts this stack over an engine somebody else owns (the
    gateway hosting the page in its own process) instead of building one here.
    The host keeps every process-lifecycle responsibility: it started cron and
    the memory backend and will stop them, it owns ``subagents.set_submit``
    (a subagent's result turn into an IM conversation must run on the host
    spine, whose hubs can route any channel's delivery -- this stack's hub only
    knows the page's; the host routes the relays that belong to page sessions
    back to this stack's scheduler, exposed as ``RpcStack.turn_scheduler``, so
    they queue behind the page's own turns instead of running beside them),
    and this stack's teardown then stops only what it built (its brokers and
    its turn spine). The page-facing sinks and brokers are applied either way; a host
    with a question surface of its own then re-binds ask_user through a
    per-conversation routing shim over this stack's broker (exposed
    as ``RpcStack.question_broker``) and its own, so the page answers its own
    sessions' questions without swallowing the host's -- see
    ``RoutingQuestionBroker`` and the gateway's page mount.

    ``channel`` names the delivery channel this stack's turns run on, and it must
    reach *both* collaborators or nothing is delivered at all: ``build_rpc_spine``
    registers its outlet under this name, and ``register_turn_methods`` stamps it
    on every turn it submits as ``source.channel``. ``spine/turn.py`` states the
    consequence outright -- the default channel MUST match the channel the outlet
    was registered under, or the reply is dropped -- so passing it to one and not
    the other loses every turn silently. Defaulted to ``"tui"``, which is what
    both sides already used, so existing callers are unchanged.

    ``approval_responder`` replaces the shell-approval transport for this stack's
    watched turns (a USER turn, or a SUBAGENT relay into a conversation a surface
    is watching). The broker built here emits ``approval.request`` on the same
    ``send_frame``, which is right for a client that implements that method and
    useless for one that does not -- an ACP client speaks
    ``session/request_permission`` instead. Only the transport is replaced:
    classification, the one-command scope and the absence of any always-allow
    state all stay where they are. ``None`` keeps this stack's own broker, so
    existing callers are unchanged.

    ``emitter`` and ``ensure_stack`` belong to a host that can assemble this
    stack a second time -- ``raven serve``, whose first run comes up without a
    loop because no model is configured yet and builds one once the page writes
    the config. ``ensure_stack`` is what ``config.set`` asks to do that: the
    handler decides whether the moment calls for it, the host owns the
    assembly. ``emitter`` hands the replacement stack the subscriptions the
    live one already holds; built fresh, every stream open on the socket would
    go quiet.
