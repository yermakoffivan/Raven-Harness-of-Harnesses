"""``turn.*`` real handlers.

* ``turn.send`` submits the turn onto the spine (one per ``session_key``) and
  returns ``{turn_id, accepted: True}`` synchronously; streaming output flows
  out via the build_rpc_spine hub/sink as ``SubscriptionEmitter`` notifications.
* ``turn.subscribe`` wraps ``SubscriptionEmitter.register``.
* ``turn.unsubscribe`` wraps ``SubscriptionEmitter.unregister`` (idempotent).
* ``turn.cancel`` cancels the in-flight turn handle and emits the one
  ``error`` event with ``reason="cancelled_by_client"`` (the sink stays silent
  on a cancelled TurnFailed to avoid a double error).

The handlers are exposed at the module level so tests can patch the
``_resolve_model`` seam. ``register_turn_methods`` closes the ``emitter`` and
the build_rpc_spine bundle (``scheduler`` / ``turn_ids`` / ``build_error``) into
single-argument dispatcher handlers.
