"""The permission gate: one decision waterfall over every tool call.

``check`` is the pure decision -- builtin rulings, user rules, then the mode's
reading of the ask tier -- and ``enforce`` is its turn-side half: the per-turn
dedup, the approval round-trip through whatever responder the entrance bound,
and the mapping onto a ``ToolResult`` the registry can answer the call with.
Every refusal continues the turn (``Continuation.CONTINUE``); the one path that
ends it is a human choosing "deny and stop" in the approval prompt.

Two grants outlast the click. "For this session" remembers the action's keys
on the conversation (``raven.permissions.session``), and a later call whose
every still-asking part was granted runs without a prompt. "Don't ask again"
writes the prefix rule the human confirmed into ``permissions.tools.exec``,
after the same validation the prompt's suggestion went through; the gate reads
config live, so the rule holds from the next call, and no session grant is
kept beside it -- taking the rule back means being asked again. A pattern that
fails validation still grants this once and this session -- the human did say
yes -- and the reason it was not written is logged.

``allow_ask`` is fixed per gate, not read from the turn: a sub-agent's task
inherits the parent turn's context by asyncio's own rule, so a gate built for
an unattended registry must refuse to ask even when a responder is visible in
its context.
