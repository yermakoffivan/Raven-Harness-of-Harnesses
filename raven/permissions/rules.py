"""User rules and default tiers: which standing one tool call has.

The user's ``permissions.tools`` node maps a tool name to a tier, or -- for
``exec`` -- to a table of command patterns each mapping to a tier. Several
matching rules resolve to the strictest (deny > ask > allow), never to the one
written last. A call no rule speaks about falls to the tool's default tier:
read-only tools run, everything else asks -- with one exception, and
``DEFAULT_ALLOW_TOOLS`` says why it is there: ``deliver_files`` hands the user
a file they asked for, which is not a read and is not an effect they approve.
``exec`` is the one tool whose default reads its argument: a command every
segment of which only reads (``READ_ONLY_COMMANDS`` and its three companions)
allows, everything else asks. A tool that both reads and changes defaults by
action instead (``DEFAULT_ALLOW_ACTIONS``): ``plugin`` finds and lists without
asking, and connects, authorizes and removes only after a human says so.

Exec pattern matching is prefix-by-token on the raw command, deliberately
without wrapper stripping: ``git *`` must not allow ``sudo git push``. A
compound command allows only when every segment allows. Segments come from the
shell lexer, so punctuation inside quotes stays text; what the lexer hands back
as its own token is shell syntax, and three kinds of it narrow what a rule may
say. Command and process substitution, backticks and heredocs run something
the token view cannot see, so the whole command answers only to a ``*`` rule.
A redirection is lifted out before matching and its target judged on its own:
a relative path without ``..`` lands under whatever the cwd is and changes
nothing, ``/dev/null`` and an fd dup write nothing, and any other target -- an
absolute path, ``~``, a variable -- again leaves only ``*`` rules. ``$VAR``
inside a word stays a word: expansion splits words, it cannot make a command
boundary. The builtin classifier (``raven.permissions.builtin``) keeps its own,
stripping view of the same command; a rule here can never lift what it rules.

A deny rule reads the other way, because what it stops is a program, not a
spelling. It is asked before any of the narrowing above, about every command
the string can be seen to run: behind a wrapper (``sudo``, ``env``, ``bash -c``,
``xargs``, ``doas``, ``watch``), inside a substitution, after a shell keyword,
under a path (``/usr/bin/curl``). So ``curl *: deny`` beside ``*: allow`` stops
``bash -c "curl x"`` and ``curl x > /tmp/out`` as it stops ``curl x``. What it
still cannot see is a command a program builds for itself -- ``python -c``, a
script file, an alias -- which no reading of the token stream reaches.

The same token view says what a session grant remembers and what prefix the
approval prompt may suggest (``exec_approval_shape``), and what a prefix typed
into that prompt may look like before it reaches the config
(``validate_exec_pattern``).
