"""Mount the served page inside the gateway process.

`raven serve` standalone assembles WsGateway + build_rpc_stack + the aiohttp
app around an AgentLoop it builds itself. This module performs the same
assembly around the gateway's existing loop, so the browser page and the IM
channels run on one engine. Every piece is serve's own, imported rather than
copied: the auth model, the app routes, the serve.json shape `raven web` and
the GUI shell read, the update announcer.

Deliberately NOT ported from `_serve_main`: ``set_surface("page")``. It is
process-wide, and this process serves IM channels and the page at once, so a
global declaration would mislabel every channel turn's trace. Instead each
client names itself per connection in ``system.hello`` (the page sends
``page``, the shell ``shell``, the TUI relay ``tui``); a connection that
declares nothing falls back to the channel name.
