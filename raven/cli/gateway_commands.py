    ``tui`` is deliberately NOT derived from ``gateway.page.enabled`` here. The
    partition has to follow the mount's outcome, not the config's intent:
    ``mount_page`` yields the page to a resident standalone `raven serve`, so
    "enabled but not mounted" is a routine state in which this process has no
    ``tui`` outlet at all. Claiming ``tui`` from config would then burn a whole
    model turn on a reminder the hub drops, and a restart would delete a
    past-due one-shot the serve process could still deliver. The caller adds
