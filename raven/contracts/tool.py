class ToolResult:
    """A tool's output split into the model-facing text and an optional
    human-facing display string.

    ``execute`` may return a bare ``str`` (model text only — the UI falls back
    to a generic preview of it) or this, when the tool wants a cleaner
    transcript rendering than what it feeds the model. ``display_text`` must be
    built from the tool's own execution data, not by re-parsing ``model_text``.

    ``retryable=False`` suppresses the registry's generic change-approach hint.
    ``blocks_call=True`` tells the agent loop this call did not run and the
    sibling calls in the same model response must not either; ``continuation``
    says what becomes of the turn afterwards. Two fields because they are two
    decisions -- see :class:`Continuation`.

    ``blocks`` carries multimodal content parts (OpenAI-shaped ``text`` /
    ``image_url`` dicts) for tools whose result is not expressible as text — a
    read of a PNG, say. It is strictly *additive*: ``model_text`` must stand on
    its own, because only providers that can carry an image in a tool result
    ever look at ``blocks`` (see ``supports_image_tool_result``). Everything
    else — the sentinel, subagents, the curator, session export, a provider
    talking Chat Completions — keeps using the text and must still make sense.
    So a tool setting ``blocks`` puts the metadata *and* the file path in
    ``model_text``, never "see the image above".

    ``diff`` is a unified diff of what the call changed on disk, for a UI that
    renders the change itself. Only a writing tool can produce it -- by the time
    anyone else looks, the content it replaced is gone -- and it never reaches
    the model, so ``model_text`` still has to say what happened on its own.

    ``file_change`` is the same change unrendered: the path and the whole file
    before and after. A surface that draws its own diff needs the contents rather
    than somebody else's rendering of them, and it cannot recover them from the
    unified form -- ``_unified`` emits limited context and drops a rewrite over
    400 lines entirely. Set beside ``diff`` by the same tools, from the same two
    strings they already hold; ``before`` is ``None`` only when the file did not
    exist, which is a distinction a client renders differently.

    ``removed`` is the other half of that record: the files this call made
    vanish. No tool deletes as its purpose, so it is the shell tool that reports
    it, from what it saw on disk either side of the command; empty means nothing
    vanished, which is what every other tool reports.
