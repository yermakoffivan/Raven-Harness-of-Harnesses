/* The approval sheet.
 *
 * An approval request is the same kind of interruption as ask_user -- the turn
 * is blocked on the reader -- so it wears the same clothes: the sheet above the
 * composer, numbered options, Esc or the close button means no. A centred modal
 * made the two read as different classes of event and put the answer somewhere
 * the reader was not already looking.
 *
 * Beside the rack rather than in shell/, because it is a tenant of it: one sheet
 * appended to #sheetRack, filed under the conversation that asked. That is also
 * why its opener is the composer's rather than a domain of its own -- the
 * rack's six names are already the composer's, and this is the seventh thing
 * the page does to that rack.
 *
 * What is here is each sheet's own element and the answers it can give; the
 * markup inside them is features/composer/AskApproveSheet.tsx (the preview variant) and
 * features/composer/GateSheet.tsx. The element belongs to this module because the
 * rack files it under a conversation and styles it as its flex item, and so does
 * the key handler, which lives as long as the request rather than as long as its
 * interior: a parked sheet is unmounted and still pending.
 *
 * "The conversation that asked" is a fact the caller has to carry in, not one
 * this module can read: see `owner` on :func:`open`.
