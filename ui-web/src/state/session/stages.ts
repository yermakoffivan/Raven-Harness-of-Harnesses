/* What a turn event means to the conversation it belongs to.
 *
 * One stage per contract event, declared in the order the page has always
 * handled them, and one exhaustive `switch` that picks the stage -- so a member
 * added to `TurnEvent` is a compile error here rather than a frame the page
 * drops in silence. The four the contract declares and the page does not draw
 * (`permission.review`, `tool.progress`, `dag.node_stalled`, `media`) get a
 * stage that says so; the two the page used to handle and nothing ever sent
 * (`cron.started`, `cron.finished`) are gone.
 *
 * Every stage takes the runtime the frame is about, which is what replaced the
 * page-level `live` object AND the page-level name for whose turn was running:
 * a frame's conversation is the one that holds the open step, the say buffer
 * and the calls in flight it is going to touch, and the one the page is showing
 * is the only conversation a frame is ever applied to -- `stream` in
 * ./pipeline.ts holds the others' frames rather than applying them.
