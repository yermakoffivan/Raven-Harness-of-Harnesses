"""Invariants of provider resolution, and guards that keep them single-sourced.

Provider resolution answers a handful of questions -- how a model id splits into
a route prefix, which names refer to a provider, whether a prefix or a keyword
decides. Each question used to be answered independently at several call sites,
the answers drifted, and fixes then landed at one site while the others kept the
old behavior. That produced a routing defect where a gateway's key was sent to
the vendor named in the model id.

So these tests come in two kinds. The sweeps assert each invariant holds for
*every* registered provider rather than for the case that was last fixed.

The source guards are line scans, and they are tripwires rather than proofs: a
deliberate rewrite (`.partition("/")`, a spliced attribute name, an aliased
import) walks past them. What they catch is the shape that actually recurred --
the same spelling copied to a new call site -- and they name the single-source
function in the failure message, which is the part a future reader needs.
