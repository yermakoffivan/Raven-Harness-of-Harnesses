"""The agents/ ppt launcher: rendering, refusals, the trunk exec, the pinned face.

The exec target is installed raven's own ``raven acp``; the deck capability
reaches it as the ppt-engine wheel through the entry-point group, never by
directory. The launch contract is still the fork launcher's ACP half: an own
key reaches every provider block, PPT_MODEL/PPT_API_BASE apply on the own-key
branch only, the context window recalibrates from the host's model catalog,
secrets merge into a rendered 0600 config whose parent decides the data dir.
Three renders are this hosting's own trunk seats: the agent home pinned under
the state root (a pooled loop must not share the host's), the engine skill
directory mounted through skillForge.localDirs, and the retired tools.ppt
block dropped from a carried config with the successor named (D4's floor).

The hermetic tool-face pin is live now (the code family's w96 shape): the
loop built from this render advertises the fork's config intent respelled to
plugin admission -- ten deck tools plus the fork's base face -- with every
trunk-new tool the fork never registered held out by config, not by luck.
The key-gated pair (web_search, ppt_image_search) joins only with a Serper
key, the fork's own registration refusal.

The fork's identity trio (SOUL.md/AGENTS.md/TOOLS.md) is carried
byte-for-byte at the engine wheel's prompts home; the engine plugin's hook
seeds it into the pinned home at first turn (tests in the plugin family),
so this launcher still seeds none of them.

    an engineless install listed-but-disabled instead of failing at dispatch);
    the model this product recommends; and the briefing sentence in the
    description. The fork told the delegating agent to "give detailed
    requirements of the deck", and on the host that reads as an order to fill in
    the audience, the length, the style and an outline the user never stated --
    measured on a live instance: "make a deck about Shanghai's city plan" became
    a 13-point brief, the deck agent had nothing left to ask, and the user was
    never asked anything. This row carries no briefing sentence at all. It once
    carried the opposite instruction, to hand over the user's own words; making
    the row ``hidden`` then put it out of the delegating agent's reach, and the
    instruction has been inert since. Raven-Design's row is the one that agent
    reads and carries the same instruction, so the behaviour is delivered there
    and repeating it here only lengthens the one prompt this text does reach.

    The fourth is the routing half of that same description. This row is hidden
    and reached only through Raven-Design's ``routes``, so the one reader of its
    text is the host's route classifier, and the fork opens by inviting source
    paths -- "name existing absolute paths in the task text when you have source
    documents" -- which that classifier reads as a deck request whenever a task
    merely cites a .pptx. Measured over 40 bilingual tasks at 5 repeats on two
    models: the fork's opening sent "design a brand style guide from
    /data/keynote.pptx" to the deck agent 10 times out of 10, while naming the
    deliverable, denying the source case and covering deck-template wording
    scored 400/400 on the same set. Everything the host router reads stays the twin's:
