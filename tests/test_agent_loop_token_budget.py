"""How much of the context window a turn holds back for the answer.

A request names an output ceiling, so the reservation is that exact number: the
prompt and that reply have to fit the window together, and handing out more
means the sum is refused at request time -- a refusal whose recovery only
elides tool bodies, so a history grown on conversation dies there.

Which makes the *spelling* load-bearing, not only the arithmetic. The
reservation and the request have to resolve from the same model id, and the id
a request goes out under is not always the one it was configured with (see
`_wire_output_ceiling`). What the catalogue's implausible rows used to make of
this -- a ceiling equal to the window, leaving nothing for history -- is
handled upstream, where such a row is distrusted (see `providers.rates`).
